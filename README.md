# BBClassify
## Purpose
Provides a Python implementation of the beta-binomial psychometric classification models (Livingston and Lewis, Hanson and Brennan) for estimating the accuracy and consistency of classifications (e.g., grades).

## Want to contribute?
- Contributions focusing on improving estimation times and performance increases in general are very welcome.
- Discussion about UI input (what should be included, how to implement necessary changes needed to correct bbclass).
## Future directions
- GUI/TUI equivalent to bbclass.
